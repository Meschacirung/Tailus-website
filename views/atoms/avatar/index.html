                <p>TailwindUI, TailwinduiKit and other UiKits based on Tailwindcss, like any other UIKit, are component systems of the given design systems.
                    The design system allows a team to collaborate efficiently on a project or in a company, it prevents the team from going off in all directions when creating a user interface for a product.</p>
                <p>It contains: visual identity, best practices, guidelines and components.</p>
                <p>Design system is a philosophy of a given project or company to ensure consistency of branding elements and especially that of the system of components.</p>
                <p>This implies that the Design System must be accessible to all team members or to anyone outside the team using a component or the whole  components system of the Design System.</p>
                <p>The problem with TailwindUI, TailwindUIKit and others is that they are based on Design Systems but are only accessible to their respective team members and not to outsiders using their components.</p>
                <p>When designing a user interface using their components, you have to guess at the guidelines to be able to customize your components and adapt them to your brand.</p>
                <p>If you want to create other components, they may not be compatible or consistent with the imported components of a given UIKit. And when working in a team on a UI, you may be confronted with bigger problems than you can imagine, each one may modify the components as he likes and in the end have a result that does not represent your UI as well as you imagined.</p>
                <p>If you have a design system to which you adapt components from an external UIKit, so much the better.</p>
                <p>Another way to solve this problem is to offer a UIKit based on an open source and highly customizable Design System.</p>
                <p>Today I present you Tailus, a very customizable, very modern and beautiful component stack built following the rules of the Google design system (Material Design) with the Tailwindcss framework.</p>
                <p>The look of our components is: 25% Material Design, 50% of our personal touch and 25% of current web trends.</p>
                <p class="text-cyan-300">This combination gives birth to very modern and customizable components.</p>
                <p>We think we have solved the problem of UIKits with Tailus, each Tailus component is directly linked to its documentation on the Material Design website, which means that if you like one of our components but you want to add a personal touch, you will have a whole documentation to guide you and thus offer something reflecting your imagination to your users.</p>
